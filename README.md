## Overview

#### Smart Shop: Grocery Deal Analysis

Project Description:

Smart Shop is an ambitious web application poised to transform the landscape of online grocery shopping by providing users with unparalleled access to and analysis of deals offered by major retailers in Canada and potentially worldwide. Harnessing the power of leading-edge technologies including Spring Boot, React, MongoDB, and Selenium Java, Smart Shop aims to be the ultimate destination for savvy shoppers seeking the best deals on essential food items.

Features:

Web Scraping:
Smart Shop utilizes Selenium Java to meticulously crawl selected websites, such as Walmart, Zehrs, and Metro.
Through this process, a comprehensive database of deals across various product categories including dairy, eggs, meat, and more is compiled, ensuring users have access to a wide range of options.

Data Validation using Regular Expression:
Robust regular expressions are integrated into the system to validate and sanitize the extracted deal information.
This ensures that only accurate and reliable data is processed, maintaining the integrity of the platform and instilling confidence in users.

Inverted Indexing:
Leveraging advanced inverted indexing techniques, Smart Shop creates an efficient index of deal information for lightning-fast retrieval.
Users can easily search for deals based on specific criteria, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their shopping experience.

Page Ranking:
Smart Shop employs sophisticated page ranking algorithms to prioritize and present the most relevant deals to users.
Deals are ranked based on factors such as popularity, discount percentage, and user preferences, ensuring personalized and tailored recommendations.

Finding Patterns:
Through the application of advanced regular expression patterns, Smart Shop identifies and extracts key information from deal descriptions.
This enables the system to uncover trends, similarities, and unique selling points across different deals, empowering users with valuable insights for comparison.

Spell Checking:
Smart Shop integrates an edit distance algorithm using a 2D Matrix data structure for spell checking deal descriptions.
Typos and spelling errors are automatically detected and corrected, ensuring the accuracy and professionalism of the deal information presented to users.

Frequency Count:
Using the Red-Black Tree data structure, Smart Shop efficiently stores and analyzes the frequency counts of various products.
This enables the system to identify popular products and trends in deal offerings, providing valuable insights for users and retailers alike.

Search Frequency:
Smart Shop offers users insights into the top frequent search terms along with their respective search counts.
By creating a max heap using PriorityQueue, the system efficiently retrieves and displays the top 10 search terms, keeping users informed about trending topics and popular products.

Word Completion:
Smart Shop implements word completion functionality using Trie data structures to suggest product names as users type in the search bar.
This enhances the user experience by providing real-time suggestions, speeding up the search process, and facilitating efficient navigation of the application.

Reason to go with Trie:
Trie data structure is chosen for word completion due to its efficiency in storing and retrieving words with common prefixes.
Its fast retrieval time and low memory footprint make it an ideal choice for providing accurate and responsive suggestions to users.

Comparing Deals:
Smart Shop facilitates easy comparison of deals on similar items across different grocery stores.
Users are presented with comprehensive comparisons of deals, allowing them to evaluate factors such as price, quantity, and brand reputation to make informed purchasing decisions.

Smart Shop is poised to change the way users approach grocery shopping, providing them with the tools and insights they need to make smart purchasing decisions and maximize savings.
